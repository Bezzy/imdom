# IMDOM

__THIS SOFTWARE IS UNFINISHED DON'T HAVE HIGH EXPECTATION__

What if we could write something like that

```javascript

if (button(id, color)) {
  // The button have been clicked do something...
}

```

This simple paradigm is enough to simplify ui development.

Only a simple vdom is prodived right now.
